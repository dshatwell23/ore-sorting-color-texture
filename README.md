# Real-Time Ore Sorting Using Color and Texture Analysis

This repository contains 2000 sample sub-images that were used to train the mineral classification model. We present 500 sub-images for each of the four mineral classes: vein (VE), breccia (BX), andesite (AN) and altered andesite (AA). All sub-images have dimensions 64x64 and were saved using lossless TIFF compression. The original images from which the sub-images are created were captured using a Sony DSC-HX90V camera.
